# BowOnPoeClicker
Repository for Game 477 Group Project

Weclome to the repository for the game BowOnPoeClicker!
Here is a quick start up guide

Setting up Local GitHub File (Only has to be done once):
•	Post your email so I can send you an invite to allow updating to the GitHub repository.

•	Install GitHub desktop 

•	Goto the GitHub repository website for the game and click the green button on the right labeled Code>Download Using GitHub Desktop.

•	The project should download to Documents>GitHub>Game Name or you can change the folder.

•	Click Clone, Initilize GitLFS if it asks.

•	Add a link to this project folder in Unity Hub.

•	Open project in Unity.

When ready to upload changes:

•	Save and Close out of unity.

•	Inside of GitHub desktop, create a summary and description, make sure all changes are checked. Make folders like Library are not added.

//////MAKE SURE THAT FOLDERS SUCH AS LIBRARY, TEMP, BUILD, LOGS, USERSETTINGS, ETC HAVE NOT BEEN CHECKED OR IMPORTED. These files need to stay local which the .gitignore should be doing.///////

•	Click commit to master.

•	Click push to fully upload to repository. 

Be sure to fetch origin before starting any work for the day so that you don’t rollback anyone’s stuff. I think the desktop app should be able to catch this.
